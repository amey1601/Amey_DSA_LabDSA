    Q2 - BINARYSEARCHTREE.JAVA
    
    
  
### Question â†’ 1)  Write a program of Balancing Brackets, use a suitable data structure to print whether the string entered is a Balanced Brackets or Unbalanced String

For this question I have not hard coded the input , I have used the scanner class to take a String input from the user and check if it is balanced or not.





### Question 2) Find a pair with a given sum in Binary Search Tree

In this question I have hard coded the input as given in the question , but as a comment I have also given the code required to take the inputs like " total nodes in the BST" and then "value of nodes "  from the user and work on the BST created after taking inputs from the user.
